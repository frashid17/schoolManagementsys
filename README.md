# User Authentication System

This is a simple user authentication system implemented in Visual Basic. It allows users to create an account with a username and password, and later log in using those credentials. The program saves the user credentials to a text file for future logins.

## Features

- **User Registration**: Users can create an account by providing a username and password. The password must be confirmed to ensure accuracy.
- **Login**: Registered users can log in using their username and password.
- **Credential Storage**: User credentials are saved to a text file (`user_credentials.txt`) for persistent storage.
- **Password Matching**: During login, the program checks if the entered username and password match any saved credentials.
- **Error Handling**: Basic error handling is implemented to handle cases such as empty fields and password mismatch.

2. **Open the Project**: Open the project in Visual Studio or any other compatible IDE.

3. **Build and Run**: Build the solution and run the program to launch the authentication system.

4. **Create an Account**: Click on the "Create Account" button and enter a username and password. Confirm the password to create an account.

5. **Login**: After creating an account, you can log in using your username and password.

6. **Logout**: To log out, simply close the application window.

## Important Notes

- **Security**: This is a basic implementation for learning purposes and should not be used in production environments without proper security measures.
- **Password Security**: In real-world applications, passwords should be hashed before storage to enhance security.
- **Error Handling**: Error handling can be improved for better user experience and robustness.
- **Feedback**: Feel free to provide feedback or contribute improvements to the codebase.
